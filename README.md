# Car-calculator
The idea of this calculator is to help customers find their right car
Nowadays, it's very difficult for anyone to determine what car fits their wallet perfectly. For this purpose, we have developed an app that does the job. The future car is based mostly on your financial portfolio as well as personal and professional profile. Log into the calculator and enter your details. If you follow the steps to the end, you will be able to find your new car. 

Remark:
The file works with a CSV file that is saved on my desktop. To retrieve the information for you as well, download the "cars.csv" file and save it to your desktop under the same name. Then copy the path and paste it on lines 80,82,84,86,88,90,92 in the front_end file. If you want to see how the back_end file works then paste it at lines 92,95,98,101,104,107,110,113,116 in the file.

Important! The project can only work with the front_end file
